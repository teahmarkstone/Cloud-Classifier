# Cloud-Classifier
Spring 2022 AIT Deep Learning Project

Authors: Teah Markstone and Madeline Grace McLaughlin

Summary:
This deep learning model is trained on various images of clouds in order to classify them as 

High cloud types:
Cirrus
Cirrocumulus
Cirrostratus

Medium cloud types:
Altocumulus
Altostratus
Nimbostratus

Low cloud types:
Stratocumulus
Stratus
Cumulus
Cumulonimbus

The goal of this project is to use the model to identify the types of a cloud based on an image.
