# Mushroom-Classifier
Spring 2022 AIT Deep Learning Project

Authors: Teah Markstone and Madeline Grace McLaughlin

Summary:
This deep learning model is trained on various images of mushrooms in order to classify them into 6 different genuses: Agaricus, Amanita, Boletus, Cortinarius, Entoloma, Hygrocybe, Lactariusm, Russula, and Suillus. Once built, this model will correctly classify images of mushrooms into their respective genuses. 

Ideally, this model could be used in conjunction with a mushroom identifier mobile application so that users could take a picture of a mushroom in the wild and identify to which genus it belongs. Dataset was collected from the "Mushrooms classification - Common genus's images" dataset posted by @CatoDogo on Kaggle.
